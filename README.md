# not-a-build-harness
A docker container that contains a bunch of tools, meant to be used in build/test automation. Dreams of someday being renamed to `defenseunicorns/build-harness`

Think twice before using this. There's been about 5 minutes spent on it, and it might get killed on a whim.

Usage:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/defenseunicorns/not-a-build-harness/not-a-build-harness:<tag>
```
